# n programming, a module is a piece of software that has a specific functionality. 
# For example, when building a ping pong game, one module would be responsible for the 
# game logic, and another module would be responsible for drawing the game on the screen. 
# Each module is a different file, which can be edited separately.

# There is lots of built in modules are available in python and we can imprort it
# directly in our code
# Modules in Python are simply Python files with a .py extension. The name of the module will 
# be the name of the file. A Python module can have a set of functions, classes or variables defined and implemented.

# for example 
from datetime import timezone

# this import statatement import timezone form datetime modules

import numpy as np

# this import numpy package in our code and we can use this package any where in our code locally.
