# This is the basic hello world programme in python syntax

print('Hello folks ðŸ˜Ž !! \nThis is your first Python Turorial')

# To run this just open teminal in current directory and type hello_world.py
# Output looks like this:

# Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both tabs and 
# spaces are supported, but the standard indentation requires standard Python 
# code to use four spaces. For example:
x = 1
x = 2
x = "String"
print(x)

if x == 1:
    # indented here for execute this block of code under if condition
    print("\nX is 1.")
    # \n is used to add new line in strings.
